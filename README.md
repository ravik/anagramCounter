# anagramCounter
This program takes in an array of strings and returns the number of anagrams.
For example, given an array of strings ["abc", "def", "cba", "ghi", "fde"]
the system would return 3, the number of unique anagrams
One pair of anagrams is "abc" and "cba", another pair is "def" and "fde"
and the last pair is just "ghi"
